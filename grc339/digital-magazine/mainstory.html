                  <h2>Emerging Runway Stars</h2>
                     <p>The collaboration between KNWLS and Jean Paul Gaultier has brought a fresh, subversive energy to the fashion scene. KNWLS, known for its edgy, body-conscious designs, has seamlessly integrated Gaultier's iconic, provocative aesthetic into their latest collection. This collaboration features pieces like spiral-boobed mini dresses and criss-crossed crop tops that draw inspiration from Gaultier's legendary cone-breasted corsets and tattoo-illusion leotards. These designs challenge traditional notions of femininity and power dressing, creating a blend of high-octane, femme fatale looks that resonate with today's fashion-forward women.  </p>

The brand’s collaboration with Jean Paul Gaultier amplifies this vision, incorporating elements that challenge traditional notions of femininity and power dressing.

The tops feature intricate strap work and form-fitting cuts, which emphasize the wearer’s figure while offering a modern take on Gaultier’s theatrical flair​ (Mytheresa)​.
